# Lab 06

## Notes

* Run in a Linux environment, I ran this in Ubuntu but I prefer using Arch Linux flavor Anarchy.

* To compile, first type "make clean" and then "make"

* There are three options for the user: 

1. Recursive method for summation of array

2. Iteration method of summation of array

3. Node stacking

* The recursive methods used is not really recursive as this is was generating random arrays. The node stacking file has restrictions as well. Very limited code as I have been busy with other programming assignments.
