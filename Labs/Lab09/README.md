# Lab 09

I was a bit pressed for time so just followed the lab as is. The test should run but on the 6th block there is an invalid block. Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

### Please Exclude the following files 

* makefile 
* DoubleLinkedNode.java
* DoublyLinkedList.java
* main.java

### Instruction to run 

1. Have all the files in an IDE, perferablly IntelliJ IDEA. 

2. Then just run the Test cases. The 6th block will cause an error so comment that part out since it is asking for an index out of bounds to alievate the error. 

3. If there are any questions or concerns, please let me know as I was a bit strained to do something fancy for this code assignemnt and only did the bare minimum.
