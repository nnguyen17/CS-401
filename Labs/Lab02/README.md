# Lab 02

This lab is to understand "compareTo" and "compare" methods in java. This essentailly comapres a class called "Studnets" using the "compare" method and then compares the inner workings like comparing the elements such as "names" or "ID" is done by using the "compareTo" method. 

Here we were tasked with creating a class called "Students" with the vairables of ID and name. From there we were able to implement getters and setters with the overall output using the toString method within the class. The program first compares students by names, if the names were the same then IDs were compared. 

The input from the user, is a menu based with gaining the information of Student's name and ID. The program will output be a sorted list of the students entered, first by name, then by ID. The test case from this program can be anything regarding to the user's need. The user must apply the test cases and nessary fail safes have been implemented for invalid inputs. 


## Notes

* This program should have all nessary interface but I have not tried to break the application yet. 

* There could be improvement to user interactions on this application with a more friendly menu interface instead of the primative menu. 

* If there are any updates that need to be made for the assignment please let me know. If not, I will cease it at this point.
