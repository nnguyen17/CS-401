# Lab 03

## Notes

* I have changed a bit of the code but the test cases are working perfectly. I apologize for removing certain comments as they did not look like in a professional manner. All the input is from the user, and if there are any questions or concerns, please let me know.

* There is a "main" file that will run all the function. 

* The "Date" file will contain all the functions needed to execute from the user input.

* The "SafeDate" file will make sure the date inputed from the user is in fact a valid date.

* The "IncDate" file will either incremente the date or decrease the date by one day. This will also change the month or year depending on what date is being affected.

* The "DateOutOfBoundsException" file will throw the error if an incorrect date is inputed by the user. 

* Lastly, this code generate the showcase of classes, inheritance, and exception cases all in one neat little program.
