# Data Structures

* Organization structures to represent data relationships.

* Arrays: Their components are accessed by their positions in the structure. 

* Linked List: A linked list is a collection of separate elements, with each element linked to the other one that follows it in the list. Think of it as a chain of elements. 

* Stack: A strucutre with a LIFO strucutre. The defining fesuters of a staick is that whenever you access or remove an elemnet, you work wit hthe element that was recenetly inserted. No matter the internal represetnation is, as long as there is LIFO relationship at play, it is a stack. 

* Queue: They are opposite of stack in that they are FIFO. The defining structure of a queue is that whenever you access or remove an element from a queue, you work with the eleement in the queue the longest. 

* Sorted List: Elements of a sorted list display a linear replationship. Each element has a predecessor and each element has a successr. This is essentially an array but the term is a sorted list. So it is a type of array. 

* Map: Also knowns as dicitionaries, tables, asssoicatetive arrays are used to store key info ordered pairs. Maps give infromationed quickly when an appriorate key is provided. There is many types of maps, but they all follow one rule which is that keys are unique and a key maps onto a single inrfomration node. 

* Tree: Trees are nonlinear, eaching element of a tree is capable of having many successor elements called children. A child can only have one parent. There is always a special beginning elemenet called root. Root is the only element in the tree that does not have a parent. 

* Graph: A graph is made up of a set of elements called nodes or vertices and a set of edges that connect the vertices. Unlike trees, there is no restrictions on the number of connections to a specfied node. Typically, the connections describe relationships amoung the vertices. In some cases, weights are assoicated with the edges to represent some feauture of the relationship. 

# What the hell is a data structure anyways? 

There is two different categories for this. Which are implementation-dependent and implementation-independent. Array and linked list are consider data strucutres (implementation dependent strucure). Another way to look at this is that any view of organizing data as a data strucutre. This will include stack and the graph (implementstation independent stucutre).
