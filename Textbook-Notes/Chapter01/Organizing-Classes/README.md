# Organizing Classes

* Inheritance allows programmers to creat a new class that is speicalization of an existing class. This new class is called a "subclass" of the existing class that in tunr is the "superclass" of the new subclass.

* Immutable are things that offer protection from the objects within it from being changed. 

* Inheritance tree is esenatilly defines inheritances relationships. In java particullar only one class can extended only one other class. 

* Polymorphism allows an object variable ro refernces objects of different classes at different times during the execution of a program. The variable can be said to have many forms givnign the name of polymorphic varible or polymorphic referene. 

### IMPORTANT COCEPT 
Inhertineces, overrding of methods, and dynamic binding all interact to support polymorphic references. Becuase objects carry with them information about their class, that information can vary dynamcially, as long as it satisfies the is a relationship established by the inheritance tree.
