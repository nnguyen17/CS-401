# Exceptional Situations

* Some steps below has to be taken in before going forward. 

* Defining the exception: Usually as a subclass of Java's Exception class

* Generating the exeption: By recofnizing the exceptional situation and then using Java's throw statement ot announce that the exception has occured. 

* Handling the exception: Using Java's try-catch statement ot discover that an exeption has been thrown and then make the appropriate actiion. 

* Java "Runtime Exceptions" do not need to be handled explicitly. If we elect not to handle them and they are raised, they will eventually be thrown out to the java internpreter and our program will be bombed. 

* This will cause an unreadable of so many try, catch, and throw statements. These errors are classifed as unchecked exceptions.
