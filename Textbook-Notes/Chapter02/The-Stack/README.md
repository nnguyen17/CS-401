# The Stack 

* A stack is Last-In-First-Out rule. Kinda like a stack of boxes. A stack is access-controlled structure in which elements are added or removed only from one end, hence a LIFO strucuture. A stack maybe considered ordered because elements occur in sequence according to how long thety have been in the stack. The elements that have been in the stack the longest are at the bottom and the most recent on the top. 

* When we begin using the stack, it should be empty. This means that we have at least one class constructor that sets it to the empty stack. There is a few operations to note that are related to stacks. 

* Push: Operation that adds an element to the top of the stack. This is strickly a transformer.

* Pop: Operation that removes an elements from the top of the stack. This is strickly a transformer. 

* Top: Returns the top of the stack. This is strickly an observer. 

* Stacks are often used to store postponed obligations. When possible or necessary the previously postponed obligation is removed from the stack in which it was stored and processing continues on it. Many variations on this theme occur within computing systems software including call-return stacks and process stacks.
