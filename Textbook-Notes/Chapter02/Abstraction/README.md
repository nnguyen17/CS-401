# Abstraction

* Abstraction: A model of a system that includes only the details essentail to the perspective of the viewer of the system. 

* An important note, abstraction is a key tool in the contruction of large complex systems. We partition our systems into separate modules, each with their own responsibilities. The details of each module are hidden inside the module, this means that a module present only a controlled interface to its functionality to the outside. 

* Module: A cohesive system subunit that performs a share of the work. In java the primary module mechanism is the class. Decompsoning a system using classes and obijects generated from classes helps us handle complexity. 

* Information Hiding: The practice of hiding details within a module with the goal of simplifying the view of the module for the rest of the system.

* Data Abstraction: The separation of a data type's logical properties from its implementation. This has the ultimate goal of hiding the irrelevant details of the computer's view of data from our own this is another view. 

* Data Encapsulation: Programming language feature that enforces information hiding, allowing internal representation of data and the details of the operations on the data to be encapsulated together within a single construct.
